1. Ease to develop for developers
Python: pretty easy and there are a lot of examples online
Tableau: not so easy when compared to the other two
D3: similar to Python

2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers
Python: not so easy when compared to Tableau because we have to open another window to show
Tableau: pretty easy and also useful to visualize
D3: similar to Python, need another window

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users
Python: not so easy, still need to write codes to play with figures
Tableau: should be the most user-friendly for end users, because they can easily do actions on the plot
D3: between Python and Tableau, although still needs coding, we can still get the information of plots using browser.

4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
Python: sometimes can not plot a figure with pretty high resolutions
Tableau: works well, but the computer should be powerful enough to use some functions such as preview
D3: works well, but might need enough internet speed if the data is from online

5. System requirements to run the visualization
Python: pretty low requirement
Tableau: might need a powerful computer
D3: just use browser, pretty low requirement
